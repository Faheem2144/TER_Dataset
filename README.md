**NOTE:** This code may take a minimum of 45 minutes to train when using Count Vectorizer as we are dealing with a dataset from neural netwroks instead we can import tfidf vectorizer for quick execution

code is for building a machine learning model detect emotions from text The code reads in a dataset of text and corresponding emotions, preprocesses the text data, trains a multi-layer perceon (MLP classifier on the preprocessed data, and evaluates the performance of the model using metrics such as accuracy,, recall, and F1-score.

The code includes several steps for preprocessing the text data, such as converting text to lowercase, fixing punctuation and contractions, cleaning the text, and removing stopwords. These steps are important for improving the performance of the machine learning model.

The code also includes steps for splitting the data into training and testing sets, training the MLP classifier on the training data, and making predictions on the testing data. Finally, the code evaluates the performance of the model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Overall, this code is a good example of how to build a machine learning model for text classification. It covers various steps such as data preprocessing, vectorization, model training, and evaluation. Beginners can learn from this code and apply similar techniques to build their own machine learning models.
