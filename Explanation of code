This code is for text emotion detection using a machine learning model. Here's a simplified explanation:

necessary libraries.
Load the dataset 'Text_Emotion.csv and convert all text to lowercase
Define to fix punctuation and contractions in the text. . Clean the text by removing unnecessary characters, URLs, and HTML tags.
Remove common English stopwords from the text.
Check for missing and duplicate values in the dataset and remove them.
Prepare the data by separating text and emotion labels.
Vectorize the text data using CountVectorizer.
Split the data into training and testing sets.
Create an MLPClassifier model for emotion detection.
Train the model using the training data.
Make predictions using the testing data.
Evaluate the model using confusion matrix, classification report, and accuracy score.
